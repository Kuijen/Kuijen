## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I mainly focus on softmodding game consoles and older games and working on 3D assets to be used in VRChat.
I also play around with hardware from time to time like working with older computers but usually I stick to software related things.
I keep most stuff I make for myself or close to a few people at most.

I am mostly active on discord so here's @kuijen should anyone need me.
